## Notes on how we are going to join with the NHL API
   
I want to check when the game threads are created. Maybe we can we partition the day from utc tag?
 - I think bofei is right. It automatically converts to the time zone we are in. 
    - need to take this into consideration

# Using Subreddit's created_utc

The subreddits all have different rules as to when they create threads so I had to find a method to get the correct day that they were playing. Since UTC midnight falls around 2pm, this could be problematic when we repartition by date.

I went through all the threads and found that we can create an adjusted created_utc that gives us the exact day that the game was played on, and that matches the API day format. This would make repartitioning the data so much easier.

    #"hockey" - day is good
    #"leafs" - day is good
    #"hawks" - day is good
    #"DetroitRedWings" - day is good
    #"penguins" - day is good
    #"canucks" - day is good
    #"BostonBruins" - day is good
    #"Flyers" - day is good
    #"Habs" - day is good
    #"SanJoseSharks" - day is good
    #"caps" - day is good
    #"NewYorkIslanders" - day is good
    #"wildhockey" - day is good
    #"rangers" - day is good
    #"devils" - day is good
    #"BlueJackets" - + 4hrs (if we dont we miss 5)
    #"TampaBayLightning" - day is good
    #"EdmontonOilers" - day is good
    #"ColoradoAvalanche" - day is good
    #"stlouisblues" - day is good
    #"goldenknights" - day is good
    #"AnaheimDucks" - day is good
    #"winnipegjets" - + 4hrs to timestamp (for all)
    #"Predators" - day is good
    #"canes" - day is good
    #"sabres" - day is good
    #"CalgaryFlames" - day is good
    #"losangeleskings" - day is good
    #"OttawaSenators" - day is good
    #"DallasStars" - +3hrs (if we dont we lost three)
    #"Coyotes" - day is good
    #"FloridaPanthers" - day is good

# Hockey subreddit on partition_by

I think saving in the following file system format would be good.

- Canucks
    - 05/02/2021
        - canucks_subreddit
        - flames_subreddit
        - hockey_subreddit
        - twitter_data

Two formats:
    
    a. "Game Thread: Washington Capitals (37-15-5) at Arizona Coyotes (28-24-8) - 15 Feb 2020 - 08:00PM MST"
    b. "Game Thread: San Jose Sharks at Arizona Coyotes - 14 Jan 2021 - 07:00PM MST"
