This package is used for scraping tweets.

Instruction:

The following command line will need to be run from the project root directory.
`python -m twitter_scraper gamestats/linescore/raw/match_linescore_in_20xx.json gamestats/all_teams.json`



This package takes two inputs.

1. Path to the linescore raw json file
    This argument determines the games that the scraper should look for. The corresponding files are generated by `nhl_api_etl`, and are organized by year.
2. Path to team names file
    This argument help the scraper to generate keywords. 
The output will be stored in `twitter_data/raw/`. If errors like `CRITICAL:root:twint.run:Twint:Feed:noDataExpecting` emerged, please refer to the twint issue fix below.

For the next stage to work, the directory `twitter_data` would need to be put into HDFS manually.
`hdfs dfs -put twitter_data/`

### Twitter Scraper Notes

1. Twint had an issue of not being able to retrieve historical tweets beyond 10 days. But there's a fix for that: uncomment line 92 of `twint/url.py`. [original issue link](https://github.com/twintproject/twint/issues/1266)
2. the search term character limit is 500
3. it assumes the date you give it is UTC time and would convert it to the local time for you. The granularity of time is the day, not down to the second as it advertised. PST and PDT wouldn't be considered.
